# development version

-   Uses `fontawesome6` (<https://ctan.org/pkg/fontawesome6>) CTAN package for LaTeX now. This brings the same set of icons as FA 6.7.2 for LaTeX too. `regular` icons are now supported. (#42)

-   Update to FontAwesome 6.7.2 for HTML. The HTML dependency inserted by the extension now uses the same version as the fontawesome assets included in the extension.

# v1.2.0

-   Update to FontAwesome 6.5.2 for HTML
